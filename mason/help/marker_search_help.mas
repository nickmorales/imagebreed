<p>
The <a href="/search/markers/markersearch.pl">marker search</a> is a
tool for locating markers in SGN's database.
</p>

<h4>1. Marker name</h4>
<p>
If you know the name of your marker, type it in. By default, the database will be searched for all markers with a name that <i>starts with</i> what you type in.For example, if you type in "TG1", your results might include TG1, TG10, TG11, TG150, etc.
</p><p>
 To search for an exact name, choose "exactly" from the menu. Or choose "contains" if you don't know the beginning of the marker's name. For example, a "contains" search on "T16" will include CT16, T1600, T1601, etc.
</p>
<p>
The search is not case-sensitive; "Tm2" and "TM2" are equivalent searches, though those two names could refer to two different markers in our database.
</p>

<h4>2. BAC associations</h4>
<p>
</p>


<h4>3. Species</h4>
<p>
In this multiple-select box you will see a list of the common names of species (or groups of species, such as "tomato") that make up the mapping populations in our collection of maps. Selecting a species here limits your search results to markers that have been mapped in that species.
</p>


<h4>4. Mapped by</h4>
<p>
This multiple-select box shows a list of experimental protocols. Selecting one or more of these protocols, for example CAPS, will limit the search results to markers that have been mapped with this protocol.
</p>


<h4>5. Group</h4>
<p>
Some of our markers have been grouped into collections for organizational purposes, or because all markers in that group are part of a particular project. Here are the meanings of the markers in our collections:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>COS</b> - Conserved Ortholog Set, markers that have been mapped in both tomato and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. </li>
<li><b>COSII</b> - Conserved Ortholog Set, part II - markers that have been mapped in several asterid species, including several solanaceous species. <a href="http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/markers/cosii_markers.pl">Learn more about COSII markers here</a></li>
<li><b>KFG</b> - Known Function Genes - markers that correspond to known genes in tomato</li>
<li><b>P</b> - a subset of our EST collection</li>
<li><b>TM</b> - also EST-derived markers</li>
</ul>


<h4>6. Chromosomes</h4>
<p>
Choose a chromosome from this box to limit results to markers mapped on that chromosome or linkage group.
</p>


<h4>7. Position</h4>
<p>
If you are interested in a particular region of the chromosome, enter the bounds of that region here.
</p>


<h4>8. Confidence</h4>
<p>
Some of our markers have a confidence assigned by the mapping program MapMaker. To view only markers with a certain level of confidence or greater, select that confidence from this list. Markers not mapped by MapMaker will have a confidence listed as "uncalculated". Leaving this setting on "uncalculated", the default, will not exclude any markers.
</p>


<h4>9. Maps</h4>
<p>
This multiple-select box shows a list of our available maps. For more information on these maps, see the <a href="/cview/">map overview page</a>.
