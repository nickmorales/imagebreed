<p>The Solanaceae, also called nightshades,
          comprise more than 3000 species many of which evolved in
          the Andean/Amazonian regions of South America in habitats
          that vary dramatically and include rain forests that
          receive more than 3 meters of rainfall annually to
          deserts with virtually no rainfall and high mountains
          with regular snowfall and subfreezing temperatures.</p>

          <p>The center of diversity of the Solanaceae is near the
          equator and thus species were undisturbed by the ice ages
          and have had time to accumulate adaptive genetic
          variation for extreme ecological niches. The Solanaceae
          are also the third most important plant taxon
          economically and the most valuable in terms of vegetable
          crops, and are the most variable of crops species in
          terms of agricultural utility, as it includes the
          tuber-bearing potato, a number of fruit-bearing
          vegetables (tomato, eggplant, peppers), ornamental plants
          (petunias, Nicotiana), plants with edible leaves (Solanum
          aethiopicum, S. macrocarpon) and medicinal plants (eg.
          Datura, Capsicum).</p>

          <p>Solanaceaous crops have been subjected to intensive
          human selection, allowing their use as models to study
          the evolutionary interface between plants and people. The
          ancient mode of Solanaceae evolution, coupled with an
          exceptionally high level of conservation of genome
          organization at the macro and micro levels make the
          family a model to explore the basis of phenotypic
          diversity and adaptation to natural and agricultural
          environments.</p>

          <p>Some Solanaceae plants are important model systems for
          biology; these include tomato for fruit ripening and
          plant defense, tobacco for plant defense, and petunia for
          the biology of anthocyanin pigments.</p>

          <p>Recently, the phylogenetic classification of the
          Solanaceae has been <a href=
          "solanum_nomenclature.pl">revised</a>. The genus
          Lycopersicon was re-integrated into the Solanum genus, as
          had been the case in Linnaeus' classification.</p>
